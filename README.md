a development environment to play around with ghost theming

Some links to organize my thoughts (will need to come back around later to document this properly):

- [How to Install Ghost Locally](https://docs.ghost.org/install/local/)
- [Developing Themes](https://docs.ghost.org/install/local/#developing-themes)
- [`zutrinken/attila`'s Ghost Theme](https://github.com/zutrinken/attila)
